    It's late and I'm awake, staring at the wall<br />
    Open up my window, head floats out the door<br />
    No one else around, the shimmer takes my eye<br />
    I lift my head, blinded by the sky<br />
    Feel my weight in front, following the sound<br />
    Moves away so fast, fall down to the ground<br />
    I know there's more to come, jump back to my feet<br />
    Now I only see ahead of me, chasing down the street<br />
<br />
    Gave my love to a shooting star<br />
    But she moves so fast that I can't keep up, I'm chasing<br />
    I'm in love with a shooting star<br />
    But she moves so fast, when she falls then I'll be waiting<br />
    Gave my love to a shooting star<br />
    But she moves so fast that I can't keep up, I'm chasing<br />
    I'm in love with a shooting star<br />
    But she moves so fast, when she falls then I'll be waiting<br />
